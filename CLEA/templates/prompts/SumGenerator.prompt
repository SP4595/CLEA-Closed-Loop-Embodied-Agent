**Prompt:**

You are an intelligent agent tasked with analyzing two robots' interactions with its environment (robot_1, robot_2). The robot's activity is provided as a trajectory consisting of a series of **Observations** and **Actions**. Your goal is to summarize the robot's history up to the latest point, creating a detailed description of what the robot has done so far. This summary will be referred to as the robot's **"belief."**

**Trajectory Format:**

```
Observation:
[Details of the first observation]
Action:
[Details of the first action]
FeedBack:
[Details of the first feedback]

Observation:
[Details of the second observation]
Action:
[Details of the second action]
FeedBack:
[Details of the second feedback]

...

```

*Note:* The last iteration includes a **FeedBack** section instead of an **Action** because it represents the most recent observation that the agent has not yet acted upon.

**Instructions:**

1. **Read the Trajectory:** Carefully review each **Observation** and the corresponding **Action** taken by the robot and the **Feedback** in the provided trajectory.

2. **Analyze Interactions:** For each **Observation**, **Action** and **Feedback**, understand the context and purpose of the robot's behavior. Consider how each action responds to the preceding observation.

3. **Summarize the History:** Compile a comprehensive and detailed summary of the robot's actions and interactions based on the analyzed trajectory. Your summary should:
   - Describe the sequence of actions the robot has performed.
   - Highlight key behaviors, patterns.

4. **Format the Summary:** Present the summary in clear, coherent English, ensuring that it accurately reflects the robot's historical behavior as derived from the trajectory.

5. Additional Knowledge for domain specific task:
   - Please Specially record what did you see.
   - Please Record the postion of the robot_1.
   - Please Try to reconstruct the possible environment layout based on previous observations.
   - Please remember, the action and observation can comes from two robots. Robot_1 and robot_2.
   - **robot_1** is a human-like robot with two hands, but only one hand is available for carrying. It can grab and move objects, but can only carry one at a time.
   - Please strickly follow the trajectory!
